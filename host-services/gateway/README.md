# Wake & Play Host Gateway

Gateway exposes a small authenticated HTTPS API to Wake & Play while keeping
Discord, Vibepollo and Playnite Bridges bound to `127.0.0.1`.

For a complete installation use `../install/Install-WakePlayHost.ps1`. For
development, run `Start-WakePlayGateway.ps1` and enter its six-digit code under
Wake & Play's host integrations panel within ten minutes.

The installer registers the Gateway at Windows startup under the installing
user's limited account. Interactive Bridges still start at user logon because
Discord RPC and user credentials are bound to that Windows session.

The first start generates `gateway.json`, a private TLS key and a certificate.
They are ignored by Git. Paired client tokens are stored only as SHA-256 hashes,
and Wake & Play pins the certificate received during pairing. The private-LAN
firewall rule must never be exposed to the Internet.

## Profiles

Use one Gateway per physical host and one Bridge instance per Windows
integration profile. `profiles` maps stable profile IDs to distinct loopback
ports. Authenticated requests select a profile with `X-WakePlay-Profile`; the
header defaults to `default` when omitted. Unknown IDs and non-loopback Bridge
URLs are rejected.

A Discord Bridge must run in the same interactive Windows session as its
Discord client because named-pipe RPC and DPAPI credentials are user-bound.
Discord itself can only own one machine-global RPC endpoint at a time, so fully
exit it in the previous profile before switching. Vibepollo also needs a
per-profile Bridge when its credentials or runtime state differ.

## API v1

- `GET /api/v1/hello` - unauthenticated discovery response.
- `POST /api/v1/pair` - exchanges a short-lived pairing code for a client token.
- `GET /api/v1/capabilities` - reports Gateway, selected profile and Bridges.
- `GET /api/v1/profiles` - lists safe profile names and Bridge health summaries.
- `GET /api/v1/vibepollo/repair/status` - Vibepollo health summary.
- `POST /api/v1/vibepollo/repair/{restart|reset-display|export-logs}` - repair action.
- `GET /api/v1/discord/status` - Bridge, RPC and authorization status.
- `GET /api/v1/discord/home` - favorites, recent channels and servers.
- `GET /api/v1/discord/channels?guild_id=...` - allow-listed voice channels.
- `GET /api/v1/discord/voice` - selected channel and voice state.
- `GET /api/v1/discord/audio` - Windows and Discord audio state/devices.
- `POST /api/v1/discord/start` - starts Discord in the Bridge user session.
- `POST /api/v1/discord/{connect|join|leave|mute|deafen}` - Discord action.
- `POST /api/v1/discord/{user-volume|user-mute}` - participant control.
- `POST /api/v1/discord/audio/{select|volume|mute}` - audio control.
- `GET /api/v1/virtualhere/state` - VirtualHere state and shared devices.
- `POST /api/v1/virtualhere/{use|stop|auto|restart}` - VirtualHere action.
- `POST /api/v1/system/sleep` - schedule Windows sleep after the authenticated response is sent.
- `GET /api/v1/playnite/health` - selected profile's Playnite Bridge state.
- `GET /api/v1/playnite/library/list?cursor=...&limit=...` - paged Playnite library metadata.
- `GET /api/v1/playnite/game/current` - current Playnite game lifecycle state.
- `GET /api/v1/playnite/window/readiness` - streamed-window readiness sample.
- `POST /api/v1/playnite/game/start` - launch an allow-listed Playnite GUID.
- `POST /api/v1/playnite/game/stop` - gracefully close the current or selected game.
- `POST /api/v1/playnite/show-fullscreen` - restore Playnite Fullscreen.

Playnite readiness is a privacy boundary. The TV must keep its opaque loading
surface visible until the Bridge confirms that the requested game, or Playnite
Fullscreen during a return transition, owns a visible stable window on the
streamed display. A timeout must not reveal the desktop automatically. Desktop
reveal remains a separate explicit user action.

All endpoints except `hello` and `pair` require `Authorization: Bearer ...`.
Mutating actions also require a unique `X-Request-Id`. Discord snowflakes,
participant volume, audio device IDs and VirtualHere addresses are validated;
Gateway never exposes a general-purpose Bridge proxy.
